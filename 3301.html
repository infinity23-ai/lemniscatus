    <h2>What means Dead Man's Switch?</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>Deadswitch is a dead man's switch. You upload data, select a trigger date, and set your switch password. If you fail to terminate your switch before the trigger date, the data you uploaded is auto-distributed to your selected recipients.
    It's essentially an insurance policy. If you possess sensitive data and are at risk of being murdered/arrested, you can leverage a dead man's switch to ensure that data will survive in any circumstance you might not.
